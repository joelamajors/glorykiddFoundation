          Accutrol, LLC, develops software for industrial automation. When we needed to improve our system architecture skills, we turned to GloryKidd Technologies for our training needs. Mr. Dave Nuckolls provided training at a retreat during which he led our team through the fundamentals of architecting, demonstrating principles using one of our major projects as a tutorial. The process of architecting a system, as time consuming as it is, inevitably yields a design that saves much more development effort than that spent on architecture. We were very pleased. Not only did we receive outstanding training, we also came away with a complete and elegant system architecture.
