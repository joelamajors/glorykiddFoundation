          <h3>Accutrol LLC</h3>
          <p>Accutrol, LLC, develops software for industrial automation. When we needed to improve our system architecture skills, we turned to GloryKidd Technologies for our training needs. Mr. Dave Nuckolls provided training at a retreat during which he led our team through the fundamentals of architecting, demonstrating principles using one of our major projects as a tutorial. The process of architecting a system, as time consuming as it is, inevitably yields a design that saves much more development effort than that spent on architecture. We were very pleased. Not only did we receive outstanding training, we also came away with a complete and elegant system architecture.</p>

          <h3>Turley's Place</h3>
          <p>I first met David Nuckolls over 12 years ago and over the years, we have become not only business associates, but also  great friends.   I have never worked with anyone quite as professional and detail oriented as David, who also adds the personal touch and caters to his clients' individual needs.<br /><br />
    I am an international recording artist and seasoned producer, who has interacted with many record labels and managers, but no one has been more hands-on making sure that I have everything that I need. <br /><br />
    Being a blind man in a technologically advanced world, causes lots of problems that most sighted people have difficulty conceptualizing.  As a small example, consider my screen reader for my computer: I was having difficulties learning the system, and most likely would have given up on the computer world, but  what did David do?  He studied the  program (JAWS,) and taught me the finer details of how to use it, which provided me a link to the sighted world that I had never before realized.  Whenever I am "stuck," David cheerfully accesses my computer via remote sharing, and patiently walks me through the learning process. <br /><br />
    I mention these things because I think it is important that the reader understand how much David truly cares about his clients.  If you are considering David as someone to meet your needs in the computer world, I fully believe you will never find someone as dedicated as he is to please you and do one hell of a great job.</p>

          <h3>AJ Bischoff Designs</h3>
          <p>GloryKidd Technologies has been a pleasure to work with over the past few years to create and maintain my website. They have expertly answered my questions regarding various aspects of my site from wallpapers to widgets. In 2014, David contacted me to let me know of the latest that GloryKidd Technologies has to offer. I was able to upgrade my website to a new platform and add eCommerce and a shopping cart. I was more than thrilled of this opportunity, and even better is that my new site is easier to use and to add items for sale. Dave worked with me on the layout and content of my new site, offered ideas to help draw in customers, and took my ideas and said, "Yes, we can also do that with this new platform." I am sure he can help anyone looking to create a website for themselves or their company, and from a simple blog to full on eCommerce. I highly recommend his services.</p>

          <p>Advent and Glorykidd have been working together for more than ten years.  During that time, David Nuckolls has developed multiple web and desktop applications for us that are used on a daily basis.  He is always responsive to our needs and is very patient when explaining how things work.  He has helped me personally with my attempt at learning how to read and write code so that I can do some of my own troubleshooting.  Dave works hard to ensure that our programs are scalable and makes valuable suggestions on what further automation can be provided to make our processing more efficient.  It is always a pleasure to work with him!</p>
