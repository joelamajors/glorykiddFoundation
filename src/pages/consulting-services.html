        Accutrol, LLC, develops software for industrial automation. When we needed to improve our system architecture skills, we turned to GloryKidd Technologies for our training needs. Mr. Dave Nuckolls provided training at a retreat during which he led our team through the fundamentals of architecting, demonstrating principles using one of our major projects as a tutorial. The process of architecting a system, as time consuming as it is, inevitably yields a design that saves much more development effort than that spent on architecture. We were very pleased. Not only did we receive outstanding training, we also came away with a complete and elegant system architecture.

      <h4>Security Services</h4>
      <p>Security goes deeper than your hardware, software and applications. It touches every layer of your network infrastructure and requires a holistic defense strategy that aligns people, processes and policies. We prioritize security in everything that we do, but we also specialize in security assessments and overhauls to safeguard one of your most precious assets—your data.</p>
