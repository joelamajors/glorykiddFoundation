    <h4>Advent Financial Systems</h4>
    <p>Advent and Glorykidd have been working together for more than ten years. During that time, David Nuckolls has developed multiple web and desktop applications for us that are used on a daily basis. He is always responsive to our needs and is very patient when explaining how things work. He has helped me personally with my attempt at learning how to read and write code so that I can do some of my own troubleshooting. Dave works hard to ensure that our programs are scalable and makes valuable suggestions on what further automation can be provided to make our processing more efficient. It is always a pleasure to work with him!</p>
