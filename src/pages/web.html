        <h4><img src="/assets/img/icon/icon-notice.png" />Only The Basics</h4>
        <p>The Basics Plan gives you all the essential hosting features you need to accommodate a "just getting started" website or an existing average-size blog, personal, or business website. The Basics Plan works well even for smaller online shops with a reasonable number of products. You will most probably outgrow this plan if you start attracting more than 10,000 unique visits per month on a regular basis. Includes all the Standard Features!</p>

        <h4><img src="/assets/img/icon/icon-notice.png" />The Professional Plan</h4>
        <p>If you need more resources and premium features in addition to the essential features then we recommend The Professional Plan. This plan is designed to accommodate either a single more heavily-trafficked website or multiple average-size websites. This is a popular plan among customers who prefer to host all their sites in one account, or want to draw a crowd with extensive social media integration. This include everything in the Basics Plan plus Premium Features like Customer Accessible Backups and SEO Optimizations.</p>

        <h4><img src="/assets/img/icon/icon-notice.png" />The Ultimate Plan</h4>
        <p>If you have a really heavily-visited or resource-intensive website then The Ultimate Plan is your best option. The Ultimate Plan offers a completely different and more geeky server infrastructure with more powerful machines. Additionally this plan is great for average to large-sized e-commerce websites because it can accommodate a much larger product line. This includes everything from the Basics and even more premium features like Social Media Integrations, Google Ad-Words Campaigns, and  Facebook Ad Campaigns!</p>
