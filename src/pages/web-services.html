      <h4>Turley's Place</h4>
      <p>I first met David Nuckolls over 12 years ago and over the years, we have become not only business associates, but also great friends. I have never worked with anyone quite as professional and detail oriented as David, who also adds the personal touch and caters to his clients' individual needs.</p>
      <p>I am an international recording artist and seasoned producer, who has interacted with many record labels and managers, but no one has been more hands-on making sure that I have everything that I need.</p>
      <p>Being a blind man in a technologically advanced world, causes lots of problems that most sighted people have difficulty conceptualizing. As a small example, consider my screen reader for my computer: I was having difficulties learning the system, and most likely would have given up on the computer world, but what did David do? He studied the program (JAWS), and taught me the finer details of how to use it, which provided me a link to the sighted world that I had never before realized. Whenever I am "stuck," David cheerfully accesses my computer via remote sharing, and patiently walks me through the learning process.</p>
      <p>I mention these things because I think it is important that the reader understand how much David truly cares about his clients. If you are considering David as someone to meet your needs in the computer world, I fully believe you will never find someone as dedicated as he is to please you and do one hell of a great job.</p>

      <p>GloryKidd Technologies has been a pleasure to work with over the past few years to create and maintain my website. They have expertly answered my questions regarding various aspects of my site from wallpapers to widgets. In 2014, David contacted me to let me know of the latest that GloryKidd Technologies has to offer. I was able to upgrade my website to a new platform and add eCommerce and a shopping cart. I was more than thrilled of this opportunity, and even better is that my new site is easier to use and to add items for sale. Dave worked with me on the layout and content of my new site, offered ideas to help draw in customers, and took my ideas and said, "Yes, we can also do that with this new platform." I am sure he can help anyone looking to create a website for themselves or their company, and from a simple blog to full on eCommerce. I highly recommend his services.</p>
